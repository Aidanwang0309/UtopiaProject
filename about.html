            Have you ever had the strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced, has already been experienced in the past,
            this year. Scientist finds that it is because of the Delta Waves (.5
            TO 3 HZ). This is a slow, loud brainwaves (low frequency and deeply penetrating, like a drum beat). They are generated in deepest meditation
            and dreamless sleep. Delta waves suspend external awareness and are the source of empathy.<br>
            During the experiment. They find this wave can still stimulate the empathy of human and even deliver
            the full image sometimes to the volunteer. Scientist believes that this wave is connecting to the memory storing and emotion generating.<br>
            Scientist finds that neuronal synapse can receive the Delta Wave. The effect and receiving condition depend on how many waves the receiver received
            and how sensitive the neuronal synapse is. At the same time, They detect that human is keeping releasing the Delta Wave, which contains their emotion
            and memory. They were trying to find a media to store this brainwave. Some scientists use the magnetic field successfully store the micro-current.<br>
            The scientist creates a neuronal synapse enhancer chips which can help people increase the sensitivity of our neuronal synapse. With the help of this enhancer, they create a new Machine called Sense Receiver.

            The sense receiver is a machine can store feelings and memories. It's not like a video or audio. It is a kind of feelings inside our brain and can wake up out empathy. Every time we have some reaction and feelings,
            this machine can help us capture and store the delta wave inside the machine. The wave could be released at the time with the changing of the magnetic field.<br>
            The Sense Machine upgrade and mature. People can store their emotional and memory inside the machine and share with others. The government firstly use this machine to share the victim's feeling and memory to the criminal. The result is amazing, Most criminals are fierce and cruel because they

            are lacking empthy and this machine will not only share memory and feelings but also awaken the empathy they are lacking. The government use this machine to send memory and feelings of people suffering in the war to the leader and criminal of ISIS and saw their tears.
